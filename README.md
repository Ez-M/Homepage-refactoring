# <Homepage-Refactoring>
## Description
The HTML was modified for better accessibility and CSS simplified for cleaner work.
I primarily removed redundant tags/classes, fixed the navigation links, and applied alt attributes to 
the various images. 

## Installation
Download all files and launch index.html in your browser. All images are stored and referenced locally.
